# React-flavored code challenge

After pulling down the project for the first time, download npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```

and then run your local server:
```
npm start
```

Your local server will be viewable at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

***

*Once you're set up, write your code in the `/src` folder:*
* `app.js` for React code
* `style.scss` for SCSS (or vanilla CSS)
