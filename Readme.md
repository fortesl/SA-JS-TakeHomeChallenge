# Welcome to  the Senior Advisor Take Home Challenge
Please review the associated png image. The design mocked up and illustrated there is your challenge. You now have 2 hours to complete, to the best of your ability, a fully working prototype of the design.

Pick the framework you would like to apply to the challenge by selecting the appropriate git branch
* There is a branch for angular and a branch for react. Please fork the project

Rules:
 * No Cheating -  outside help, just you and your computer
 * No additional UI frameworks (No... no bootstrap) other than those included by use in the git projects
 * No generators


Here is what we are looking for 
 * semantic, seo compliant markup
 * Application structure
 * Overall completion of the design

Bonus Points include
 * Uncluding meaningful unit testing
 * Proper documentation
 * Strong demonostration of architecture and css best practices
 * Promises (You may include a promise lib of your choice)
 * Proper State management (You may include Redux, mBox, etc)

After pulling down the project for the first time, download npm dependencies:
* There will be a readme file to guide to the appropriate next steps.
